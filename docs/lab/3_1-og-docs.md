# Chat with Original Documents

Welcome to the second half of the lab. 

**Objective:**
The objective of this section is to enable participants to understand and apply the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in updating a chatbot's knowledge base. Participants will learn the steps involved in uploading new documents and observe the subsequent improvements in the chatbot's responses, demonstrating how RAG dynamically enhances the chatbot's performance. 

**Outcome:**
By the end of this section, participants will be able to effectively upload new documents to a RAG-based chatbot and understand the impact of these documents on the chatbot's responses. They will have a clear understanding of how RAG leverages new information to continuously refine and improve chatbot interactions.
